# Linear Regressor
This file include the implemention of linear regressor on tensorflow.
The goal of the code is to implement a linear regressor where 

y = Wx +b

Then main code is adapted from tensorflow tutorial, but the official tutorial has some errors in their sample code 
according to discussion in their github issues.

This version is excutable on my computer.
